## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

This repository demonstrates key NLP concepts and techniques, such as:

- **Text tokenization:** Breaking text into meaningful units.
- **Stopwords:** Removing common words with little semantic meaning.
- **Stemming & Lemmatization:** Normalizing words to base forms.
- **Vectorization:** Converting text into numerical features (BoW, TF‑IDF).
- **Spell Correction:** Handling misspellings via edit distance.
- **Spam Detection:** A basic text classification task.

These notebooks form a strong foundation if you’re getting started with NLP with Python.
